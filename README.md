## RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval and generation techniques to improve response accuracy.
It first retrieves relevant information from a dataset based on the query, then uses a language model to generate responses incorporating this information. In the university chatbot project,
RAG enhances the chatbotâ€™s ability to provide detailed and contextually accurate answers by leveraging the university prospectus data.
